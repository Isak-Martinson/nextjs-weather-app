# Weather App

I've designed and developed a brutalistic front-end weather app using Next.js, typescript and OpenWeatherMaps free tier API. Site is live at: [brutalweather.vercel.app](https://brutalweather.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
